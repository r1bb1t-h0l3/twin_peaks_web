            <h2>Norma Jennings</h2>
            <p>I've been running the Twin Peaks Diner since I graduated college in 1980. In 1987 we started the 
            very popular <em> Meals on Wheels</em>program to support our local community. Through the years 
            my team and I have weathered quite a few storms, but we continue to uphold the quality and service that
            we are known for. </p>

            <p> I have worked with Norma at Twin Peaks ever since I graduated highschool. Through the years 
                we have been blessed with consistent support from the local community and we hope to continue 
                bringing you the highest quality comfort food in Washington.
